        Even though my primary focus lies in crafting well-structured, readable
        and maintainable code, I have also developed a deep appreciation for the
        creative aspects of the design process. The joy in creating something
        &ndash; from an idea to a physical product &ndash; is what really
        excites me the most of being a front-end developer.
